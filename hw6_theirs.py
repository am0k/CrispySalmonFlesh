# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.


###
### Problem 3
### Recognizing Types
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

colors = ['pink', 'yellow', 'green', 'red', 'purple', 'blue', 'orange']
people = {'Karen': 22, 'Bob': 20, 'Lucy': 21, 'Adam': 21}
holidays = [{'January': 1, 'December': 12}, {'January 1st': 'New Years', 'December 25th': 'Christmas'}]

print colors
print people
print holidays

#This just creates a list in dictionary

###
### Problem 4
### Identifying Values With an Index
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

 
zoo = ["antelope", "giraffe", "penguin", "gorilla", "bear"]

print zoo[0]
print zoo[2]
print zoo[4]
 
# for problem for the index values starts at zoo(index value).
# for zoo2 its not possible because zoo2 has only 1 item in the list therefore index is only len = 0




###
### Problem 5
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

candy = [{"sour patch kids":22, "sour gummy worms": 10}, {"m&ms": 13, "snickers": 1},{"laffy taffy": 5}]
print candy[0]["sour patch kids"]
print candy[1]["snickers"]

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)

###
### Problem 6: Using a For Loop With a Dictionary
### code fixed
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

drinks = {"redbull": 3, "water": 4, "fresca": 1, "pom tea": 1, "rockstar": 2}

for i in drinks:
    print i

# Answers: For this problem 6, we just use the "for loop" to pull items out 




###
### Problem 7: Understanding and Using Assert
###

# This problem use to verify the columns or rows match or not 
# For example:

assert 1 == 1
# this does not verify that it matches. Therefore this program will stop right here.

assert zoo == zoo

#this verify that it match therefore the program will continue to excute other codes.
